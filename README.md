# cpp Portfolio

Portfolio of personal projects in c++ and/or CUDA, mostly physical simulations. .cu files contain source code which is written in a combination of C, C++, and the CUDA API. Most code using the CUDA API is contained in the kernels which have the "__global__" decorator. All other code is a combination of C and C++.
